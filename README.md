⚖️ GenAI Legal Document Assistant

A Generative AI Hackathon Project built with Google Gemini API + Streamlit

🚨 Problem

Legal documents — rental agreements, loan contracts, terms of service — are full of jargon and complexity.
Most people sign without fully understanding the terms, creating risk and confusion.

💡 Our Solution

We built an AI-powered assistant that transforms complex legal documents into clear, plain language.

With our app, users can:

📂 Upload contracts or agreements (PDF/TXT).

📑 Get plain-language summaries of key points.

❓ Ask specific questions (e.g., “What’s the penalty clause if I break the lease?”).

⬇️ Export results to TXT/PDF for easy reference.

👉 This empowers individuals and small businesses to make informed decisions and avoid hidden risks.

✨ Core Features

📑 Document Summarizer → Upload PDF/TXT, get simplified summaries.

❓ Document Q&A → Ask questions about clauses, receive clear answers.

⬇️ Export Options → Save outputs as TXT/PDF.
