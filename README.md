⚖️ **Generative AI for Demystifying Legal Documents**  

A GenAI Hackathon Project built with **Google Gemini API + Streamlit**  

---

🚨 **Problem Statement**  
Legal documents—like rental agreements, loan contracts, or terms of service—are full of complex jargon. Most people agree to these terms without fully understanding them, creating risk and potential legal issues.  

---

💡 **Our Solution**  
We built an **AI-powered assistant** that transforms legal documents into clear, accessible language.  

Users can:  
📂 Upload contracts or agreements  
📑 Get plain-language summaries of key points  
❓ Ask specific questions (e.g., “What’s the penalty clause if I break the lease?”)  
⬇️ Export results to PDF or TXT for easy reference  

This empowers everyday citizens and small businesses to make informed decisions and avoid hidden risks.  

---

✨ **Core Features**  
📑 Document Summarizer → Upload PDF/TXT, receive simplified summaries  
❓ Document Q&A → Ask questions about clauses and get clear explanations  
⬇️ Export Options → Save outputs as TXT or PDF  

🔮 **Bonus Features (future scope):**  
📖 Story Mode  
💡 Motivation Mode  
🌐 Translate Mode (English ↔ Hindi)  
📝 Summarize Any Text  
💬 Free Chat Mode
